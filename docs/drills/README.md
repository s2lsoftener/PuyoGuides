# Chain Drills Overview
In this section of the site, I've organized **chain drills** for you to play through. Some drills are custom-made, while other drills are real chains made by skilled players. Think about the **build orders** behind these chains and try to incorporate them into your own playstyle.

* Down: Drop Puyo pair (all the way down)

* X: Rotate Right
