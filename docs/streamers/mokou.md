::: tip S2's notes:
A famous Japanese YouTuber with an eccentric personality and cool shades. He was kinda cocky about playing in the first Puyo Championship Cup, only to get put in his place by the longtime legends. His fans will never let him [live it down](https://kotaku.com/youtuber-apologizes-for-six-minutes-after-tournament-lo-1825316692).
