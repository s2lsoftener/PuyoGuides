<Figure :imgUrl="'/img/esports/mainmenu.jpg'" />

* **Single Puyo Puyo**: Play Tsu and Fever matches against the CPU. Puyo Puyo eSports doesn't have true single player modes, unfortunately.

* **My Data**: View your play records and set the game options.
* **Internet**: Go online to play matches against your friends or random players.


## Single Puyo Puyo

These are the two game modes you can play in this game. **Puyo Puyo Tsu** is the definitive game mode that's been in use since 1994; **Puyo Puyo Fever** is a casual friendly mode introduced in 2004. When you choose an option, the next screen pops up:

* **Battle**: Play set-matches against the CPU.
* **Endurance**: Play against CPUs one after another without stopping until you lose.

Press Y to choose a random character. Press - or + to select all characters immediately.

**Cheat**: Hold L while selecting the computer's character to max out their AI's strength.
