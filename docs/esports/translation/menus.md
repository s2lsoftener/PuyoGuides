## Title Screen
<br>
<Figure :imgUrl="'/img/esports/titlescreen.jpg'" />
You can immediately start a FT2 Puyo match against the CPU by pressing the buttons on the side.

## Main Menu
<br>
<Figure :imgUrl="'/img/esports/mainmenu.jpg'" />

* **Single Puyo Puyo**: Play Tsu and Fever matches against the CPU. Puyo Puyo eSports doesn't have true single player modes, unfortunately.
* **Everybody Puyo Puyo**: Play matches with your friends locally. The Nintendo Switch supports multiplayer on the same switch (マルチ) or multiplayer using local wireless (ローカル).
* **My Data**: View your play records and set the game options.
* **Internet**: Go online to play matches against your friends or random players.


## Single Puyo Puyo
<br>
<Figure :imgUrl="'/img/esports/singlepuyopuyo.jpg'" />

These are the two game modes you can play in this game. **Puyo Puyo Tsu** is the definitive game mode that's been in use since 1994; **Puyo Puyo Fever** is a casual friendly mode introduced in 2004. When you choose an option, the next screen pops up:

* **Battle**: Play set-matches against the CPU.
* **Endurance**: Play against CPUs one after another without stopping until you lose.

Set the number of computer opponents.

## Character Select
<br>
<Figure :imgUrl="'/img/esports/characterselect.jpg'" />

Press Y to choose a random character. Press - or + to select all characters immediately.

## Notes
There are some leftover menus that aren't translated, but I left those out because I thought they were self-explanatory.
If you have any questions, suggestions, or need help navigating the menus still, please ask on the [Puyo Discord](http://bit.ly/puyodiscord)
