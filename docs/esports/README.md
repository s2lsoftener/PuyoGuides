### Balanced Frame Data
The beauty of Puyo Puyo is timing your attacks and reading your opponent to gain the advantage. To support that, Puyo games usually have a well-tuned balance in the Puyo drop speed and other animations.

In Puyo Puyo Tetris, SEGA had to speed up Puyo's drop speed, among other things, to give Puyo a fighting chance against Tetris. For some reason, this speed up carries over to normal Puyo vs Puyo matches. The increased speed basically makes matches more random since it promotes reckless strategies.

SEGA reverted the frame timings to what they were in Puyo Puyo Chronicle, a recent Puyo game that's agreed to have balanced timings. You have to watch your opponent and manage your resources more carefully now, like you used to have to.


### Fever Mode
We can finally play Fever mode on HD consoles now! With netplay! GOOD netplay!!

Fever mode plays like normal Puyo, but with some twists. Every time you counter an attack, you fill the **Fever gauge** in the middle of the screen. Once it fills up, you enter **Fever mode**, and you'll get free chains to attack with. Fever mode helps beginners pull off big damage, while providing a new strategic tool for experts. It's fun for everyone.


### Good Music! Crush 40 Remixes
Remixes and tunes from almost every preceeding Puyo game have returned. Crush 40 also made some remixes to help you get into the Esports mood!

### Improved Online Rankings
Puyo Puyo Tetris's ranking system had a great habit of matching you up against the top players in the world before you get to even play your first match. The point system was inflated too, so you were forced to grind for ages to eventually find people around your skill level...

Puyo Puyo eSports's ranking system uses the ELO-like system from Puyo Puyo Chronicle. Basically, after winning and losing your first couple matches, you'll soon be playing with people around your skill level. Probably.

Don't take it personally if your rating points drop below the starting value of 2000. 2000 is considered a mid level Puyo player in Japan, and their standards are way higher. What's more important is to let the ranking system find the right players for you.

### Improved Replay System
Replays now auto-save, so you'll never forget to save a good match. Until all the replay save slots get filled, that is. I heard the online replay sharing functions are improved too, but I've yet to try it out.

If you press L1/R1, you can view a timeline of the match that highlights when chains were made or when garbage falls.
