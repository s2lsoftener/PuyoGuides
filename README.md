# PuyoGuides
A guide website that uses VuePress to generate static pages. I used Pixi.js to make the chain simulator, which is inside reusable vue components.
I've had to start doing difficult, unmanageable edits because of the way I made the chain simulator dependent on vue.js, so I'm rewriting it over at https://github.com/s2lsoftener/puyosim-ts
